A multi-agent coding workspace for Codex, Claude Code, and PI—with model routing, subagent orchestration, cost observability, and cross-device sync.

## Why Eco Coding

If you already use Codex or Claude Code, Eco Coding puts them in one workspace and adds what most official clients leave out:

- **Mix models** — Combine GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Kimi, and more across Responses / Messages / Chat Completions
- **Split work, cut cost** — Lead agent plans and accepts; subagents search, code, and test in parallel on cheaper models
- **Session isolation** — MCP, Skills, and tool policies per project or session—no global context pollution
- **Dedicated vision** — Give any model its own eyes (vision) and brush (image generation)
- **Transparent billing** — Know exactly what you spent per session, plus cache hit rate
- **Mobile sync** — Open-source Flutter client: remote sessions, approvals, images, and voice input; pairs with desktop over self-hosted Supabase—no subscription
- **Fully open stack** — macOS / Windows / Linux desktop + Supabase Center, MIT License

Prefer a single model? That works too—multi-agent is optional.

## Quick start

**[Download the desktop app →](https://github.com/plus1998/eco-coding/releases)** (macOS / Windows / Linux)

Run from source (Bun `1.3.14`+ and Node.js `22.14.0`+ recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plus1998/eco-coding.git
cd eco-coding
bun install
bun run dev
```

After the first launch, add API credentials under Settings → Model Providers, then create a runtime configuration. The macOS Beta is unsigned—see the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.en.md).

## Capability overview

| Area | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| Agent Core | Codex, Claude Code, and PI; selected per session |
| Orchestration | Custom lead config, subagent roster, models, and tool policies |
| Model routing | Multiple providers; Responses / Messages / Chat Completions |
| Session modes | Agent, Plan, Ask |
| Context | Occupancy, compaction, handoff recovery, file checkpoints |
| Cost | Tokens, cost, cache I/O, hit rate, breakdown and comparison |
| Integrations | MCP, Skills, built-in browser, image generation, vision model, ASR |
| Engineering workflow | Git diff, checkpoint rewind, Worktrees, terminal, code review |
| Mobile collaboration | Device pairing, remote sessions, approvals, images, voice input |

## Supported platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Artifact | Update behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | Apple Silicon, Intel | DMG / ZIP | Current unsigned Beta uses manual download |
| Windows 10/11 | x64 | NSIS installer | In-app updates supported |
| Linux | x64 | AppImage | In-app updates supported |

## Highlights

- **Three Agent Cores**: choose Codex, Claude Code, or PI per session; run different cores in the same project.
- **Session-scoped isolation**: enable MCP, Skills, browser, and image generation per session; auto-discover project Skills.
- **Multi-protocol gateway**: OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, Chat Completions, and local compatible endpoints.
- **Dedicated vision and integrations**: separate vision models; image-generation APIs and mobile ASR.
- **Fully open stack**: Electron desktop + self-hosted Supabase Center + Flutter mobile, MIT License.

### Cross-provider Agent Teams

Bind lead and subagents independently to providers, models, protocols, MCP, and Skills; built-in Explore / Architect / Coder / Reviewer / Tester templates.

### Observable cost and cache

Track cost and cache by session, agent, and model; compare orchestrated vs unorchestrated estimates.

## Orchestration and cost philosophy

Subagents and multi-agent setups address the division of complex work. A single high-capability model can complete complex tasks alone, but leaving it to search, implement, test, and review for long stretches makes context noisy and bills every step at the highest unit price. The lead agent can stay user-facing: understand goals, dispatch work, and own acceptance; concrete work goes to faster, cheaper, or locally running models. Subagents matter because they get independent task contexts, parallelize independent work, and let models of different cost and capability do what they fit.

This is Eco Coding's core idea. Almost every major model lab is shipping large and small models in the same family—exactly this trend. DeepSeek Flash's speed and ultra-low price, OpenCode 2's rewrite philosophy, and the recent ~80% cut in GPT Luna pricing all feel like part of the same wave. The idea took shape a few months ago; watching the field move step by step in this direction made it urgent to ship and open-source Eco Coding early.

<p align="center"><sub>Lead plans and accepts; workers run in parallel with isolated context and tiered pricing.</sub></p>

### A reusable setup

In Eco Coding, `gpt-5.6-sol` can serve as the lead agent or planner: it understands the request, breaks down the work, decides whether to delegate, and owns acceptance. Assign `gpt-5.6-luna` with `max` reasoning effort to execution roles such as Explore, Coder, and Tester. This is a working style validated in real use. On long tasks, actual cost can drop by about 60%–80%.

### Clear price gaps

| Route example | Input price | Input gap | Output price | Output gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` vs `gpt-5.6-luna` | `$5.00` vs `$0.20` | Sol is about `25x` | `$30.00` vs `$1.20` | Sol is about `25x` |
| `Claude Opus 4.8` vs `DeepSeek V4 Flash` | `$5.00` vs `$0.14` | Claude is about `35.7x` | `$25.00` vs `$0.28` | Claude is about `89.3x` |

### What Eco Coding does

Eco Coding connects model aggregation with task delegation. A lead agent can use a high-capability model to maintain intent and acceptance criteria, while roles such as Explore, Coder, and Tester switch to cheaper, lower-latency, or local models; different roles may also come from different providers. Eco Coding centralizes routing, protocols, reasoning effort, context isolation, tool policies, MCP, Skills, cost, and cache observability so users can see why each model was used, what it cost, and whether the orchestration is worth repeating.

It does not prescribe one permanent model or a fixed number of agents. It provides a composable dispatch and observability layer: the same task can use one agent or parallel subagents.

A cache anomaly shows that the request prefix or upstream cache behavior changed. A single alert cannot establish a provider's intent or fault; Eco exposes the evidence and leaves the conclusion to the user.
