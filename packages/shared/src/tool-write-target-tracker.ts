import { readToolWriteTargetDetail } from "./tool-write-target";

/**
 * Names the target of a tool call whose arguments arrive in fragments, without re-reading
 * everything that has arrived so far.
 *
 * The reader itself is a linear scan of the text it is given, so calling it once per fragment
 * costs O(n²) over a call: a one megabyte patch in token-sized fragments spends seconds inside it
 * and delays the Feed. This tracker keeps three properties instead:
 *
 * - it looks at the first `scanLimit` characters only, so the work per look is bounded;
 * - while the arguments are shorter than that it looks after every fragment (the text is small and
 *   the answer has to be exact, "it is being written" should become "writing /tmp/x.md" the moment
 *   the path is closed), and past it only after the text has grown by `retryGrowth` — a target is
 *   named near the front of the arguments, so the rest of a long payload is never looked at again;
 * - once the text that named the target is closed it stops looking altogether.
 *
 * The window means a target named *after* `scanLimit` characters is never read: a call that writes
 * a megabyte of content before its `file_path` is announced as「正在写入文件」rather than by name.
 * Every producer seen so far names the file or command in its opening keys — `file_path`,
 * `command`, or the V4A marker on the patch's first line — and a bounded label beats a main
 * process that spends twenty seconds re-reading the same arguments.
 *
 * One tracker belongs to one tool call. `observe` is fed the arguments as they now stand — the
 * whole accumulated text, not the latest fragment — and may be called with a snapshot that
 * replaces an earlier one (the π adapter hands whole `partialJson` snapshots).
