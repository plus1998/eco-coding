 * The desktop half of the cross-end Feed contract.
 *
 * Every corpus conversation is handed to the renderer as the runtime's own bootstrap
 * payload (`test/fixtures/feed-parity/v2-bootstrap/<id>.json`, written by
 * `scripts/feed-cross-end-fixture.ts`) and must render the shape recorded in
 * `test/fixtures/feed-parity/v2-render/<id>.json`. Mobile asserts the *same* golden from the
 * *same* payload in `apps/mobile/test/conversation_v2_cross_end_golden_test.dart`, so a
 * divergence is a difference in one renderer, not a difference in the fixture.
 *
 * The golden is generated from the desktop renderer, which is the reference here because it
 * is itself pinned to the legacy chain on this corpus by
 * `conversation-v2-real-corpus-parity.test.ts` — comparing mobile against something that is
 * compared.
