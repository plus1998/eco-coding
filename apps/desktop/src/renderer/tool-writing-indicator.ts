 * wrote next — the text block closes, then the call is written. The projection deletes the
 * field on every path that really ends the wait (the tool row landing, or the agent/thread
 * going terminal), so anything still carrying it is genuinely mid-write.
 *
 * A fact that says nothing about the call — no tool, no kind — is not worth a label; the
 * producers only omit the tool name for provider-side items (a web search), and even those
 * arrive with a kind.
