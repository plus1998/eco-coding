/**
 * Install the Electron binary when the package manager skipped it.
 *
 * Bun only runs lifecycle scripts for allow-listed packages, and in this workspace it skips
 * `electron`'s postinstall, so a clean install (CI, or a fresh worktree) ends up with
 * `node_modules/electron` present but `dist/` absent. `electron-builder` packs anyway because
 * it downloads its own Electron distribution, so the gap stays invisible until something runs
 * the `electron` CLI — then it dies with "Electron failed to install correctly".
 *
 * Run the installer Electron itself ships, then verify the binary really exists. A missing
 * binary after a successful install.js is a hard error, not a warning.
